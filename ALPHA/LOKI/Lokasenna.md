# Lokasenna - The Quarrel of Loki

## The Setting

In the great hall of Ægir, the sea god, a feast was held for the gods and elves. Ægir had two servants, Fimafeng and Eldir, who were praised by all for their service. The hall was lit by gleaming gold instead of fire, and the ale served itself. All the gods were present except Thor, who was away in the east.

## Loki's Arrival

Loki, unable to tolerate the praise given to Fimafeng, killed him in a fit of jealousy. The gods shook their shields and howled at Loki, driving him into the woods. However, he soon returned to the feast, encountering Eldir outside the hall.

## The Confrontation Begins

Before entering, Loki questioned Eldir about what the gods discussed inside. Learning they spoke of their weapons and victories while speaking ill of him, Loki declared his intention to enter the feast and blend their mead with malice.

## The Verbal Duels

Entering the hall, Loki invoked the ancient laws of hospitality, demanding a seat and drink. Only Bragi spoke against him, but Odin, remembering their blood-brotherhood, commanded that Loki be given a place.

Once seated, Loki began his systematic assault:

### The Accusations

- He reminded Odin of their forgotten blood-oath
- Accused Freya of sleeping with all gods, including her brother
- Claimed Njord was used as a chamber-pot by Hymir's daughters
- Mocked Tyr for losing his hand to Fenrir
- Taunted Freyr about trading his sword for a bride
- Accused Byggvir of cowardice
- Reminded Heimdall of his role as eternal watchman
- Mocked Skadi's vengeance for her father
- Claimed Sif had taken him as a lover

Each god and goddess rose to defend themselves, but Loki had a cutting response for each, revealing their darkest secrets and greatest shames.

## Thor's Return

The flyting reached its climax with Thor's return. Unlike the other gods, Thor didn't engage in verbal combat but threatened Loki with his hammer Mjölnir. Loki, knowing Thor would follow through with his threats, finally fled.

## The Consequences

This event marked a turning point in Loki's relationship with the gods. His words had cut too deep, revealing truths that could not be unsaid. The gods' patience had finally run out.

## The Punishment

Following these events, Loki was hunted down and bound with the entrails of his son Narfi. A serpent was placed above him, dripping venom onto his face. His wife Sigyn stayed by his side with a bowl to catch the venom, but when she must empty it, the venom drops cause Loki such pain that his writhing creates earthquakes.

## Historical Context

The Lokasenna serves as more than just a tale of insults. It represents:
- The importance of wit and verbal combat in Norse culture
- The complex relationships between the gods
- The consequences of breaking social bonds
- The tension between chaos (Loki) and order (the other gods)
- A prelude to Ragnarök, as Loki's binding marks a point of no return

The poem ends with a reminder that Loki's bonds will hold until Ragnarök, when he will break free to lead the forces of chaos against the gods in the final battle.
