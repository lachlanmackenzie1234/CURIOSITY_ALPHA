### Project Organization Guidelines

1. Test Structure
   - All tests must be placed in `ALPHA/tests/` directory
   - Tests are classified into specific directories:
     - `unit/`: Tests for individual components in isolation
     - `integration/`: Tests for component interactions
     - `analysis/`: Tests for performance and system analysis
   - Test files should follow naming convention: `test_*.py`
   - Keep tests focused and avoid redundancy
   - Each test file should have a clear, single responsibility

2. Code Organization
   - Maintain clear separation between core, utils, and test code
   - Avoid cluttering the root directory
   - Use proper import paths (e.g., `from ALPHA.core...`)
   - Keep related functionality grouped together

3. Type Annotations
   - Use string literals for forward references when classes reference each other
   - Example: `translation_bridges: Dict[str, "TranslationBridge"]`
   - This prevents circular dependencies and definition-order issues
   - Particularly important in dataclass definitions and complex type hierarchies
