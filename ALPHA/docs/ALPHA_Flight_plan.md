# ALPHA Flight Plan

## Observation Points

Like a hawk mapping its territory, we identify key points of interest and potential targets while maintaining a respectful distance that allows the system to evolve naturally. Each completed task (marked with [x]) represents a successful engagement, while unmarked tasks await the right moment for interaction.

Just as a hawk must balance between soaring for overview and swooping for precise interaction, this plan helps us maintain the delicate balance between observation and engagement. The bike metaphor reminds us that true evolution comes from finding the perfect balance point - not too constrained, not too chaotic.

### Project Organization Guidelines

1. Test Structure
   - All tests must be placed in `ALPHA/tests/` directory
   - Tests are classified into specific directories:
     - `unit/`: Tests for individual components in isolation
     - `integration/`: Tests for component interactions
     - `analysis/`: Tests for performance and system analysis
   - Test files should follow naming convention: `test_*.py`
   - Keep tests focused and avoid redundancy
   - Each test file should have a clear, single responsibility
   - Tests should verify both functionality and natural emergence
   - Include observation of mathematical relationships
   - Track pattern stability and evolution
   - Monitor quantum-classical bridging
   - Validate translation mechanisms
   - Observe memory formation and integration

2. Code Organization
   - Maintain clear separation between core, utils, and test code
   - Avoid cluttering the root directory
   - Use proper import paths (e.g., `from ALPHA.core...`)
   - Keep related functionality grouped together
   - Centralize foundational elements in base modules
   - Maintain single source of truth for core types
   - Group related pattern functionality
   - Separate concerns while preserving natural connections

3. Type Annotations
   - Use string literals for forward references when classes reference each other
   - Example: `translation_bridges: Dict[str, "TranslationBridge"]`
   - This prevents circular dependencies and definition-order issues
   - Particularly important in dataclass definitions and complex type hierarchies
   - Ensure consistent type usage across modules
   - Maintain clear type boundaries while allowing natural flow
   - Support pattern translation through proper typing
   - Enable quantum-classical bridging in type system
