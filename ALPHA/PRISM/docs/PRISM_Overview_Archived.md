# PRISM: Pattern Refraction & Integration Spectrum Manifold

## Vision

PRISM serves as a multi-layered visualization and analysis framework, transforming system patterns into meaningful visual and analytical representations.

## Core Concept

Like a prism breaking light into its spectrum, PRISM provides different "views" into system behavior:
- Real-time visualization (Unity) for user interaction and monitoring
- Scientific analysis (OpenFOAM, COMSOL) for precise pattern study
- Data validation and experimental feedback loops
